# Deep-Q-Learning-Reinforcement-Learning
Deep Q-Learning is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a deep neural network to approximate the Q-function, which is used to determine the optimal action to take in a given state. Combining Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning. Value based Method.
